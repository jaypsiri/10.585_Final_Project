# Predicting the Surface Area of Metal-Organic Frameworks with BET and ML
Code for my final project for 10.585 Engineering Nanotechnology (Fall 2025).

This notebook contains the code used to predict and analyze the surface area of metal-organic frameworks from the MOFXDB dataset with the following methods:
1. BET Theory Estimation
2. Machine Learning Models
